This was a POC for resizing an image in an Angular directive.  

This actually doesn't resize the image.  Sorry, it resizes the background to fit the viewport area.  Maybe at some point I'll actually put real image resizing in there.  This was for a specific purpose, but creating a final image should be trivial with the drawImage method.  

imageSizer.directive.js is the main file.
